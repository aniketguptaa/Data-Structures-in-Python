# Data-Structures-in-Python
Python has four basic inbuilt data structures namely Lists, Dictionary, Tuple and Set. These almost cover 80% of the our real world data structures. 
This article will cover the above mentioned topics.  Above mentioned topics are divided into four sections below.     
Lists : Lists in Python are one of the most versatile collection object types available. The other two types are dictionaries and tuples, 
but they are really more like variations of lists.         Python lists do the work of most of the collection data structures found in other languages and 
since they are built-in, you don’t have to worry about manually creating them.         Lists can be used for any type of object, from numbers and strings to 
more lists.         They are accessed just like strings (e.g. slicing and concatenation) so they are simple to use and they’re variable length, i.e. they grow
and shrink automatically as they’re used.         In reality, Python lists are C arrays inside the Python interpreter and act just like an array of pointers.
